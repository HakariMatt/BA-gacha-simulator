# Blue Archive gacha simulator in C
Literally my first project in C so i'm sure the code could be better, but it works at least.
There's no limited students, or from event stories, no banners, just a regular gacha.

Info about rates and students i took from BA wiki.

To compile just run `make` command from project directory, it will create a `roll` executable, the you can run `./roll` to execute program.

Ah yes it's for linux and maybe MacOS (not sure). I'm too lazy to download visual studio to compile it for windows, so yeah. I did it using WSL.
